# Car Sales Insights Dashboard

## Background
We are a car dealership that offers a range of vehicle models. We require a thorough Car Sales Dashboard in Power BI in order to monitor and evaluate our sales performance efficiently.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to use Power BI to build and create an engaging and dynamic dashboard for car sales. The dashboard will show important KPIs associated with our auto sales, enabling us to make data-driven decisions and comprehend our sales success over time.

## Problem Statement 1: KPIâ€™s Requirement
The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.

### 1. Sales Overview
- **Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales**
- **Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales**
- **Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales**
- **Difference between YTD Sales and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales**

### 2. Average Price Analysis
- **YTD Average Price**
- **MTD Average Price**
- **YOY Growth in Average Price**
- **Difference between YTD Average Price and PTYD Average Price**

### 3. Cars Sold Metrics
- **YTD Cars Sold**
- **MTD Cars Sold**
- **YOY Growth in Cars Sold**
- **Difference between YTD Cars Sold and PTYD Cars Sold**

## Problem Statement 2: Charts Requirement
The following charts are required to visualize the data effectively:

### 1. YTD Sales Weekly Trend
Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis should show the total sales amount.

### 2. YTD Total Sales by Body Style
Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.

### 3. YTD Total Sales by Colour
Present the contribution of various car colours to the YTD total sales through a pie chart.

### 4. YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region
Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a map chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.

### 5. Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form
Provide a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid should showcase the company name along with their YTD sales figures.

### 6. Details Grid Showing All Car Sales Information
Create a detailed grid that presents all relevant information for each car sale, including car model, body style, colour, sales amount, dealer region, date, etc.

## Implementation
The dashboard was developed using Power BI, leveraging its data visualization capabilities to create interactive and insightful reports.

### Steps:
1. **Connecting to Excel File**: Imported the sales data from an Excel file.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. **Data Modelling**: Created data models to establish relationships between different data tables.
4. **Data Processing**: Processed the data to create calculated columns and measures.
5. **Power Query**: Used Power Query to transform and load the data.
6. **Date Tables**: Created date tables to facilitate time-based calculations.
7. **DAX**: Used DAX functions for advanced calculations and metrics.
8. **Visualizations**: Created various charts and grids to represent the data.

## Conclusion
The Car Sales Insights Dashboard provides valuable insights into our sales performance, helping us make data-driven decisions and identify opportunities for growth. The dashboard enables us to monitor key performance indicators in real-time and visualize trends and patterns in our sales data.
